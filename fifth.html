         <p>Various degrees of flexability and wrist set, with indentical downswings.</p>

           <p>Some people are very extreme, look at Dustin Johnson for example.</p>
           <p>But, from there he will move like everybody else to the ball.</p>

            <h1>Wrist set at address or at the top of the backswing?</h1>
  
            <h3>Both, just don't force it and do what ever is comfortable for "you". Making sure they are set from the top of the backswing, is the only thing you need to worry about.
              Your upper body needs to remain connected, do not disconnect your shoulders from your torso from not using a wrist set. Example = Do not try to hit the ball with your arms only!
              Reducing the amount of mistakes or limiting the sequencing of your body, is the key to forming a fluid golf swing. Keep an eye on the lateral movement
              as well, if you have a medium paced backswing. The amount of lateral movement is limited and should be of no concequence in the end.
              There will how ever, be a slight amount after the ball is struck. But that is completely unavoidable, as it is a biproduct of a golf swing aka inertia. 
              So do what ever is comfortable for the wrist set, just as long as you keep the turning sequence alive. Don't feel as though you need to have a certain type of wrist set,
              you are unique and that is ok.            <a href="sixth.html" style="font-size: 40px;">&#128073;</a>
